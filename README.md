# spring-and-foundation-web-app-example

**Updated 2018-03-01:** Decided to do some "spring" cleaning and thought this old project deserved some organization

This is my first effort towards learning AngularJS and Foundation 5.

I chose to learn these together because Angular will provide me with content I can use to style with Foundation.

A good first step into AngularJS can be found at the w3schools site:
http://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp

The documentation provided by Foundation on their site has been very helpful towards getting me up and running:
http://foundation.zurb.com/

**To test out for yourself:**
+ clone this repository
+ open the code in an IDE
+ run <code>Application.java</code>
+ visit: http://localhost:8080/index.html
+ try out: http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=YourName

**No IDE? Try building and running the JAR:**
+ clone this repository
+ on your command line: <code>gradlew build</code>
+ again, on your command line: <code>java -jar build/libs/gs-rest-service-0.1.0.jar</code>
+ visit: http://localhost:8080/index.html
+ try out: http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=YourName
