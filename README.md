This is my first effort towards learning AngularJS and Foundation 5.

I chose to learn these together because Angular will provide me with content I can use to style with Foundation.

A good first step into AngularJS can be found at the w3schools site:

The documentation provided by Foundation on their site has been very helpful towards getting me up and running:
